<h1>Movie Tickets</h1>
<p>Movie Tickets is a web user interface I developed just for fun, using only HTML, CSS and JS, without any third-party libraries or frameworks. The goal was to implement the UI for a movie booking system.</p>
<h2>Brief description</h2>
<p>The user can select City, Date, Time slot and Theater when buying one or more tickets. Also, a movie theater representation let the user select specific seats, moving when the mouse hovers over them and changing color when clicked.
An offcanvas menu slides in from the right when there is at least one selection active and slides out when there is none. Additionally, I made this interface web responsive.
There are some notable differences, though, in comparison with the desktop version:</p>
<ol><li>The header menu is substituted with a menu button that, when clicked, opens up a menu sliding down from the top</li>
<li>The movie theater representation is substituted with nine isles that, when clicked upon, reveal another menu sliding in from the bottom, displaying the corresponding isle's seats. When tapping on any of these seats, they change color and a sidebar
   appears, similarly to the desktop version, but inside the menu itself</li>
<li>Clicking outside the menus described above closes them. Additionally, if one or more seats were selected, exiting from the menu resets the selected seats counter</li></ol>
<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>All the code is my own, except for the fonts (Josefin Sans and Roboto Slab), which have been selected from Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/).</p>
<h2>How to Run it</h2>
<p>Download the folder and open the index.html file.</p>
